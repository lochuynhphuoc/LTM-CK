While often synonymous with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology offers utility that extends far beyond digital finance. At its core, a blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively. This characteristic of immutability creates a system of trust without the need for a central intermediary like a bank or a government agency.
One of the most promising applications of blockchain is in supply chain management. It allows companies to track the journey of products from the source to the consumer with absolute transparency, ensuring authenticity and ethical sourcing. Additionally, "Smart Contracts"—self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code—are automating complex legal and financial processes. As the technology matures, blockchain has the potential to serve as the foundational infrastructure for a more secure and transparent version of the internet, often referred to as Web3.
