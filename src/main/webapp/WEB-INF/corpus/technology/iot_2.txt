The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a massive network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet. This ecosystem ranges from ordinary household items like smart thermostats and refrigerators to sophisticated industrial tools. In a smart home, IoT allows users to control lighting, heating, and security systems remotely, enhancing convenience and energy efficiency.
On a larger scale, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing manufacturing through predictive maintenance. Sensors monitor machinery health in real-time, alerting operators to potential failures before they occur, thereby reducing downtime and saving costs. However, the proliferation of connected devices also expands the attack surface for hackers. Securing these billions of endpoints is a major technical challenge that the industry must address to ensure the safe and reliable operation of our increasingly connected world.
